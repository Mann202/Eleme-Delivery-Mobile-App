# Eleme Delivery Mobile

## 1. Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, the demand for convenient food delivery services has surged, leading to the rise of platforms like Grab and Shopee Food. Our project aims to develop a comprehensive food delivery application that caters to the needs of modern consumers by providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

The app will connect users with a variety of local restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisines and dishes. Key features will include real-time order tracking, multiple payment options, user reviews and ratings, and promotional offers. The objective is to create a reliable and user-friendly platform that not only facilitates the ordering process but also enhances customer satisfaction through timely and accurate deliveries.

Our approach involves leveraging the latest technologies in mobile app development to ensure the app is scalable, secure, and responsive. We will also integrate advanced features such as AI-based recommendations and delivery route optimization to improve efficiency and user engagement. By focusing on both the user and restaurant perspectives, our app will streamline operations and contribute to the growth of local food businesses.

This project will be executed in phases, starting with market research and requirement analysis, followed by design, development, testing, and deployment. Through this systematic approach, we aim to deliver a high-quality food delivery application that meets the expectations of both consumers and restaurant partners.
